# AnimatedOnboarding

An example of a user onboarding process using PageViewController, derived from Mike Amaral's "Onboard", using CoreAnimation.

This onboarding process was designed and built for the [Custom Calendars](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/custom-calendars-sports-social/id993245081?mt=8) applcation which gives users access to over 5000 calendars ranging from professional and collegiate athletics, recreational events, and custom user submitted calendars.

All assets were created on photoshop/sketch, with some rendered at runtime.
